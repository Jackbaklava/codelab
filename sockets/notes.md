# Client-Server Model
- Server(s) handle the logic and communication between the clients and so they remove the need to connect to other clients, which means they are faster
- Clients are the end-user and connect to the server(s)

# Sockets
- A socket is an endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on a network.
- Each socket has an address and is created at each end of communication.
